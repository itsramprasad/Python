4. Write a Python program to get the largest number from a list.

Code:

ïƒ¨using max()
numbers = [ 56, 98, 46, 1, 73, 64 ]
largest_number = max(numbers)
print(f"The largest number in the list is: {largest_number}")

                                                            

ïƒ¨using for loop
numbers = [ 56, 98, 46, 1, 73, 64 ]
if not numbers:  # Handle the case of an empty list
    print("The list is empty.")
else:
    largest_number = numbers[0]  # Assume the first element is the largest initially
    for num in numbers:
        if num > largest_number:
            largest_number = num
    print(f"The largest number in the list (manual iteration) is: {largest_number}")


Output: The largest number in the list is: 98
